# On using SPID

SPID isn't needed per se, but it's highly recommended. \
It is used to change NPCs appearance.

Version 5.0.3 is recommended on SE, since 5.2.0 doesn't seem to work.\
5.2+ works alright on AE.

If SPID is not installed/doesn't work, you can activate an alternate method to apply appearance to NPCs by unchecking `MCM > Debug > Use SPID` in _Max Sick Gains.exe_.

SPID works reliably 99.999% of the time, while the alternate method works 95% of the time.

If any of them fail you will see NPCs bodies using a zeroed Bodyslide (ie. they are thin as fuck) and you need to use any of the the _Reset NPCs_ hotkeys to fix them.

Player appearance is always correctly setup and doesn't care about SPID or whatever, though.
