# Overview
`Max Sick Gains` is a mod that changes `Bodyslide` presets on your PC depending on fitness level. Your fitness level changes by training and sleeping.

This program was made to configure everything related to those fitness levels and how they are applied to the PC (and NPCs if you so desire).

## What's a "fitness level"
Imagine you want your PC to go on a body transformation journey. She (I'll assume your PC is a "she" because that's the most probable thing) will have many fitness levels along that journey:

* Obese
* Flabby
* Plain looking
* Fit
* Athlete

Traditionally, you would make a `Bodyslide Preset` that went from obese to athletic, use a mod that dynamically changed your weight like `Pumping Iron` or my own `Sandow Plus Plus` and let it work it's magic.

That would work quite fine for the extreme levels of your `Bodyslide Preset`, ie. while your weight was around 0 and around 100, but intermediate levels would look like a weird mix or fat and fit.

Not anymore.
With `Max Sick Gains` you can assign a completely different `Bodyslide Preset` for each one of those fitness levels.
