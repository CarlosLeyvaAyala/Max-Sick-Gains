# Known issues

These are issues that have are out of my control and thus I can't solve.

## Skyrim Platform CTD

- CTDs always happening when Spriggans are around? [Use this fix][SP Spriggan].

## The AE aftermath

### Special Edition

Even if you use the [downgrade patch][downgrade], you need to completely restore SE by following [this guide][hugo].\
For some reason, that AE prompt overlay on the main menu seems to mess with some mods.

Note to MO users: you don't need to replace/delete new files; it's just a matter of adding the old SE files to a new folder, then activate it.\
CC files won't trigger the AE overlay, by the way.

If you don't follow these steps **this mod won't work on NPCs**.

### Annoying Edition

This mod works alright most of the time, but now we get some weird errors that never happened on SE (Stable Edition), like _Slideshow_ on _Testing Mode_ not working because sometimes the game refuses to update morphs unless you (un)equip an armor.

Same thing happens when setting a new appearance in real time to an NPC using the _Reset NPC_ hotkey.\
The NPC would need to get their armor (un)equipped to actually reflect the new Bodyslide morphs.

The only known solution for this are these steps:

* Close the game to desktop. 
* Run it again.
* Pray it now works.
* Do steps above until it decides to work (or rage-quit and play another game).

Not much can be done by me about this particular (annoying) error, to be honest.
